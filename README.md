## `About the Beer Recipe App`

I program I wrote as an assignment awhile back, utilizing React.

### `Known Bugs`
There is a known bug where the checkbox does not show as checked when you do an ingredient search.  I was working on a solution but ran out of time.

### `Needed Improvments`
The UI could also use some touch-ups, and while I added some accessibility, I didn't fully make it accessible and would do so with a little more time.

Also, the program could really use a "clear" button to clear all the checkboxes and the entry fields.  And an ability to over-write and/or delete saved recipes would be very useful too.

Lastly while I believe it is best to have self-documentating code, this does need a little more explicit documentation.

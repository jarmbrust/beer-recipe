## `About the Beer Recipe App`

I decided to go with the problem to write a Beer Recipe since I thought it looked the most interesting to tackle.  Generally I am less familiar with React than a lot of the other technologies so in the end this proved to be a bit of a challenge.  The end result is good but I do outline below a bug that needs to be fixed and a few improvments I would do.

The ingredient search assumes a list of ingredients that is longer and less managable than the 13 I have listed, so it would help the user to find a value on the list.

### `Known Bugs`
There is a known bug where the checkbox does not show as checked when you do an ingredient search.  I was working on a solution but ran out of time.  Definitely would fix this.  

### `Needed Improvments`
The UI could also use some touch-ups, and while I added some accessibility, I didn't fully make it accessible and would do so with a little more time.

Also, the program could really use a "clear" button to clear all the checkboxes and the entry fields.  And an ability to over-write and/or delete saved recipes would be very useful too.

Lastly while I believe it is best to have self-documentating code, this does need a little more explicit documentation.
